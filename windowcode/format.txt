The format for output files of window analysis is:

A header line, for humans to read. Not of use for computers.

Then the number of repeat sizes analyzed (e.g. 3 for repeat sizes 3,6,9)
Then follow descriptions of analyses for each repeat size.

Each starts with a line containing repeat size length, followed by number of sequences analyzed, and window size.
Then follow analyses of each sequence.

For each sequence, first the number of repeat_size-tides found.
Then follow descriptions of each repeat_size-tide.
On one line, the repeat itself and the number of occurences.
Then a line containing space-separated comma-separated pairs: position in sequence where window started, and number of observations.
