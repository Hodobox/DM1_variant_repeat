X15_222
Middle variant CCGCTG, similar to DMGV14. Large left repeat, medium middle variant, short right repeat.

GO1
Very long reads; on right side, interrupted by CCGCCG hexamers followed by right CTG, both short compared to left CTG.
Some contain CCGCTG instead, usually more spread out towards the middle.
6 cascading CCG's form a recurring pattern on the rightmost side.

GO2
No N-amer variant repeat, but clear, repeated interruptions by CCG in the same place across reads, four times

GO3
What seems like a variant of CCGCTG is actually a very stable pattern of 14 CCGCTG interleaved with several CTGs at the same place across reads (1_1_4_4__2__1__1__)

GO4
similar to the above, although the variant is CCGCCG. The left part of the cascade is
longer and might have mutable length, although only within some small margin (or it
might be same length everywhere)

GO5
5-6 CCGCTG's on right hand side, again in a cascading fashion

GO6
few CCGCCG's on right side (3-5 maybe), but not particularly consistent, many reads don't contain it

GO7
Either a pattern with CCG separated by two CTG, or just CCGCTGCTG variant with some errors

GO8
slightly strange - many reads with ~14 CCGCTG, many reads with nothing, many with ~8 CCGCTG (patterns). Same reads mapped multiple times, or just similar reads mapped
arbitrarily slightly better for different length genomes?

GO9
seems like usual CCGCTG variants on the right, although a non-negligible part of them seem to have an expansion of CCGCTG in the middle of the read instead

GO10
broken, upon inspection referencer only made a size 4 anchor, though the actual flank seems quite okay. Re-run referencer with lower threshold.

GO11
No variants, except one or two A's present (a single or double CAGCTG?)

GO12
two CCGCTG expansions, one in the middle and one on the right. Need to confirm what % of reads have double, single, or no expanions. Spicy.

X4_14C
Long CCGCTG expansion

X8_15C
Short CCGCTGCTG expansion

X9_182C
Very few reads, most seem to have no expansion, a few have a short CCG trimer variant

X11_UC56
CCGCTG variant, but with many bases marked * with 'A inserted' or 'G-A inserted'?

X12_110
CCGCTG covers vast majority of read, out-covers CTG expansion

X12_54B
No variant, can't see anything which doesn't strike me as just random errors in CTG

X13_111
CCGCTG covers vast majority of read, many bases marked * with 'G-GG', 'G-GGA', 'G-GGGA' inserted?

X13_184C
??? seems like random error or something, maybe just lots of mosaicism

X14_112
Very long CCGCTG expansion

X17_UC83
CCGCTG expansion
